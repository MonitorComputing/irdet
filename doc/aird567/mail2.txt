At a quick glance .I would  agree with Howards suggestion .You would 
maybe also need a bias resistor (say 100K ) from diode anode to 
ground.There are methods of cancelling the effect of strong light.It 
is discussed in "Electronics World" of May and November 1994.I will 
look it up .
You could try the diode (pointing the same way ) connected anode to 
ground and bias from cathode to plus 5.This would also invert the 
phase avoiding the need for your inversion FET.--- In
